# ForTheLoveOfSake
Got a game idea I've wanted to do for a long time... so now I'm making a mecha/dogfighting/rpgesque game. No idea how to achieve most 
of the features I want but hey that's game dev... so here goes the next year or two of my life.
Game revolves around the player choosing an militaristic or futuristic aircraft such as an F-15 or a UFO and basically dogfighting against
automated enemies which also fly their aircraft. In addition, all aircrafts will have abilities unique to their design or stats for example:
- The F-15 will be among the fastest of all aircrafts both in plane mode and robot mode. In plane mode
the F-15 will have the ability to divert power from other systems to temporarily gain an unlimited boost unique to it. However, in robot mode the F-15 will divert that power to exceed aircraft speed limits and essentially slow down time (Similar principle to how the Flash's, a DC comics superhero, power works).

Moving forward... Yes, aircrafts will also be capable of transforming at will between the two forms to engage in long range and close quarters type of combat. Also, which aircrafts and what abilities they will have are not set in stone yet... they will be in early May 2019.

Schedule and all other important information such as the GDD and references (games, audio, art, etc.) will be located on the Trello board in early May 2019. Let me know if you're interested in collaborating.
